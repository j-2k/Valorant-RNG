# Valorant Randomizer
A simply and funny software idea for my friends. Simply generates a random weapon &amp; agent to use depending on multiple factors, with maybe some... twists I guess?

### Main Features: (Priority/100% included)
- Generate a random choice of the following categories:
  - Agents
  - Weapons


### Extra Features: (Not a priority/might not be included)
- Generate a random choice of the following categories:
  - Abilities
  - Rules?
  - Playstyles

## Build/Repository information for nerds

### Project Plans:
- Desktop Application (web is better but I want to learn desktop garbage)
- Target Windows 10 & 11
- Planning to use either imgui (cpp) or winUI3 (c#) for UI framework.


### Building the project:
- TBD
